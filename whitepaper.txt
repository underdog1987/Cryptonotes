               Whitepaper
          (Release Candidate 1)

** Abstract **
Cryptonotes is a decentralized app similar to Pastebin, but it saves data in blockchain.

1. INTRODUCTION
Paste tools like Pastebin are useful to save any kind of message, from source code, to PGP encryption keys through simple notes, letters, lyrics, etc.
Most of current paste tools have something in common: stores data in a
traditional database, i.e. MySQL, Postgres, or MongoDB. Those databases can be modified or deleted in any time.

2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Cryptonotes is a paste tool, but instead of save data in a traditional database is saves data in blockchain. Its contract is deployed in Binance Smart Chain.

There are some advantages of save data in blockchain:

i) Notes are immutable: Every created note is a transaction in BSC network, its content cannot be changed.

ii) No risk of database lost: Your notes will be safe forever.

iii) Decentralized: Your notes are always accesible.

iv) Open source: Everybody with minimum web development knowledge can create a Cryptonotes-clinet.

Unfortunately there are some things that can be considered unadvantages:

i) Zero privacy: All data stored in a public blockchain is accesible for everybody. Cryptonotes it should not be used to save private and/or personal data.

ii) Expensive gas prices: Depending on BNB price against BUSD, gas fee could be expensive, specially in large notes.

3. ROADMAP
- TBD. Deploy of Ethereum-version of Cryptonotes.
- TBD. Deploy of Cryptonotes-client in IPFS.

4. DONATIONS
If found this project useful, consider make a donation. Send any amount of BNB to the contract address 0x68d36D43b8a55B16E35fc517c987Bd171b59E662
